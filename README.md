# Project 2 - *Wordle App*

Submitted by: **Marissa Langham**

**Wordle** is an game app that lets players have a set number of attempts to guess a word, with feedback given for each guess in the form of colored tiles indicating when letters match or occupy the correct position. Users can even make the game have word themes and make the game harder by selecting "alien wordle" in settings.

Time spent: **4/5** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [X] User can change the number of letters per row (the length of the goal word)
- [X] User can change the numbers of rows on the board (how many guesses allowed)
- [X] User can select a new themed set to pull the goal word from
- [X] User can select "alien wordle", causing the goal word to change after each guess


The following **optional** features are implemented:

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [X] Improve and customize the user interface by adding an app icon
